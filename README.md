# zzPi_1.py 
### Last test was run on a single Pi using the code from line 251.
### Remaining code in this file is development work.


# zzHomeServer.py
### This is mainly development code designed to take the input from a rotary encoder and trasmit value using MQTT, a light-weight and low-latency wireless protocol. This value is picked up by a subscribed device, the Pi Zero.

### See video for demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrUUR4KpHA

### Plan is to work between two Raspberry Pi devices, both with 2 rotary encoders sharing a set of values.
