- Last test was run on a single Pi using the code from line 251.
- Remaining code in this file is development work.

- This is mainly development code designed to take the input from a rotary encoder and trasmit value using MQTT, a light-weight and low-latency wireless protocol. This value is picked up by a subscribed device, the Pi Zero, and the value shown on screen.

I'd like this to work between two Raspberry Pi devices, both with 2 rotary encoders sharing a set of values.
